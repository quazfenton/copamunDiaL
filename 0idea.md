The frontend will be an empty team formation GUI similar to the squad lineup screen that shows players on your team in soccer games etc. It will have a menu to find team  (find people to play with locally via) GPS), etc.

Center the team lineup better and remove the white background so the entire UI is the pitch/lineup and a vertical menu that goes all rhe way down with the options .
  local players finding and team building app that will ultimately be the interface for entire sports leagues and their stats/calendars/communications as well as for individual rogue players and their local game organizing

Add ability for player to add profile picture, add team profile that shows team names/history against other teams/comms for scheduling and practice etc.

3. The buttons should be:    a) my team (which goes back to the original formation page) ,    b) find match (which if the player’s current team still has empty positions then it should ask to either find new team -which opens a new black pop-up in the center [with everything else slightly blurred/dimmed] and searches for a new team while showing a circling/loading animation, then if another team is available/not full yet, will add the player to the new (non-empty) team’s formation reserves. Each player should have “captain” status over their own team so a new team is joined, the player should no longer have privileges such as editing the team’s formation/players    c) schedule (which will open a calendar of scheduled games and if an empty date is pressed the player can invite another player’s team by username and input a date, time, and location, and if accepted the new matchup will show up in the team’s calendar.    d) invite player (where a player can send an invite with a semi-transparent text field shown to manually enter a new username or (below the text field) press + on any name their list of friends and also has .  The invited player will join their team reserves if accepted) , and    e) profile (where the player has a username, bio, and can upload a profile picture and also shows their chosen positions etc. , and an edit button in the corner to edit these things including choosing their preferred position (buttons of all possible positions are shown and light up when selected; no limit on how many they can choose; the new chosen positions will show on their profile to others to see). 
4. A non-empty position/reserves player should be different from the the empty positions: shows the player’s profile picture  and 1st name also and if tapped will show their profile
5. make the players draggable to a new position. And if dropped at new position, swap with whatever is already there, This includes reserves, so if a player is dragged and held hovering over the reserves bar, open the reserves list to be able to be dropped there. 
6. Add a “captain” class as mentioned before, given by default to the original player and taken away if the player joins different team. The captain can add a team name, picture and bio similar to a player profile, also press a profile in their formation to  give captain privileges to (can be multiple) which will allow the new captain(s) to also edit the team, accept new matches on the schedule etc.
7. Players can be members of multiple teams. When the “My Team” button is pressed, options to select which team name (if they have previously joined a new team after pressing find match). By default, all teams will be named “(original player’s 1st name)’s team”. The name of the currently shown team will shown (above “Fornations”) and if pressed will go to team profile which will also have a chat icon to open a group message between players and will also have a red option to leave team.
8. Show pop-up notification (join/decline) when a player is invited, when a captain’s team is requested for a match or a player wants to join, etc.
9. Add location services for finding match, joining team etc. (match with local accounts)
